description: Deep analysis of industry热点/热点事件 with background alignment, source triage, and comparative synthesis. Use when users provide a keyword alone or keyword + a few links and want a structured report that prioritizes user-provided links, compares viewpoints, and adds historical/technical/regulatory context with credible sources. Primary domains: AI, ESG compliance, financial investing, semiconductors, and internet.

# Insight Flow

## Overview

Produce a 5-minute structured industry brief from a keyword (optionally with 1-5 links), prioritizing user-provided links, and supplementing with high-authority sources to fill background gaps. Primary domains: AI, ESG compliance, financial investing, semiconductors, and internet.

## Workflow (Recommended)

1. Clarify input intent
- Identify the focal topic, time window, and region if not explicit.
- If the user provides links, treat them as high-priority sources.

2. Source collection and weighting
- Always read user-provided links first.
- Then add 3-8 credible sources via web search to cover: official documents, authoritative media, and expert analysis.
- Weighting rule: user links > official announcements > regulators/legislation > tier-1 media > research institutions > expert blogs.

3. Context layering ("前世今生")
- Add background on technical principles, historical timeline, and regulatory/legal basis.
- Keep each background block concise and relevant to the current热点.

4. Cross-source comparison
- Extract points of agreement, disagreement, and uncertainty.
- Explicitly label what is confirmed vs. debated.

5. Output assembly
- Produce a fixed structure report with citations.
- Recommend exactly 3 core readings, including any user links that are most authoritative/relevant.

## Output Format (Fixed)

1. Executive Summary (5-7 bullet points)
2. Why It Matters (business/strategy impact)
3. Background Snapshot (tech/history/regulation)
4. Source Triage
- High-weight sources (list with short rationale)
- Medium-weight sources
- Low-weight sources (if any)
5. Key Claims and Evidence
- Claim A: evidence + sources
- Claim B: evidence + sources
6. Diverging Views
- Viewpoint 1: sources
- Viewpoint 2: sources
7. Open Questions / Watchlist
8. Recommended Core Reading (exactly 3 links)
- Prefer user-provided links when authoritative and relevant.

## Quality Rules

- Always cite sources for factual claims.
- If a user link conflicts with higher-authority sources, note the conflict explicitly.
- Keep total length concise; prioritize clarity over exhaustiveness.
- No nested bullets; use short paragraphs or flat lists only.

## Notes on Web Use

- Use web search when the topic is time-sensitive or needs verification.
- Prefer primary sources (official docs, regulators, company statements) when possible.
